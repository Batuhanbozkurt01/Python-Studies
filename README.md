# My Python Projects

This repository contains various Python projects I have created to practice and improve my programming skills.  
Projects are written in English.

## Projects

1. **Temperature Check** - Checks the temperature input and prints a message based on the value.
2. **Grade System** - Takes a score and outputs the corresponding grade.
3. **Even or Odd** - Determines if a number is even or odd.
4. **Age Check** - Checks if a user is old enough to vote.

More projects will be added as I learn more Python concepts like loops, functions, and object-oriented programming.
